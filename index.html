<h1>Song banned from Swedish charts for being AI creation</h1>

    <p class="lead">Loren ipsum</p>
    <p>A song which has been streamed millions of times in Sweden has been banned from that country's music charts 
    because it was created by Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Called I know, You're Not Mine - Jag vet, du är inte min 
- it is currently top of the Spotify playlist of Sweden's most popular songs. 
But the singer is a digital creation and the country's music industry 
body has blocked the track from its official chart listings.
<i>"Your steps in the night, I hear them go," sings the artist known as Jacub in a haunting voice.

"We stood in the rain at your gate and ran out and everything went fast. 
Now I know you are not mine, your promises came to nothing."</i></p>

<footer>AI-generated music is forecast to explode in the coming years 
    into an industry worth billions of pounds. As the needle drops on a new era of digital music creation, the controversy 
    in Sweden over Jacub suggests that for now at least it is human musicians not machines who still call the tune.</footer>
